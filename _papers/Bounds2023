Borcea and Streinu showed that the upper bound of the number of congruence classes of a minimally d-volume rigid (d+1)-uniform hypergraph on n vertices in Rd increases exponentially in n and d. We show that this result also holds for triangulations of S2 in R2, and then find a geometrically motivated bound linear in n for bipyramids. By the methods used to deduce this bound, we show that, in general, global d-volume rigidity in Rd is not a generic property of a (d+1)-uniform hypergraph.
