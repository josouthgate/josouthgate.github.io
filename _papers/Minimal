Maxwell introduced a necessary minimum number of edges in terms of the number of vertices required for a graph to yield a Euclidean rigid generic framework in R3, this count was generalised to Rd, for all d≥1. In this paper, we give the analogous minimum number of k-simplices, for all 0≤k≤d, required for a pure d-dimensional simplicial complex to yield a volume rigid generic framework in Rd, for all d≥1. In order to do so, we prove some basic facts about the volume rigidity matroid and use exterior algebraic shifting, a recently added tool to the study of volume rigidity. We later prove a volume rigidity Vertex Removal Lemma and use our count to strengthen the statement.
