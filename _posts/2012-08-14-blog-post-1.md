This is primarily a test (and placeholder) post, but also acts as a convenient place to lay out a brief plan for the blog.

I will try to keep posts coming, perhaps not frequently. I will try to maintain a bit of a balance between mathematical problems, other academic things, and non-academic things. Mostly, this will be a bit of a project for me to spend a bit of my time writing.

Maths problems will mostly be recreational (for manageability), or observations from my own research or that of others. Other academic topics would likely relate to teaching and non-academic topics to books that I'm reading / have read.
