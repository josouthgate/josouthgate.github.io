I am a PhD student in maths at the University of St Andrew under the primary supervision of Louis Theran, I have been here since 2020. Previously I was an undergraduate at the University of Bristol.

I am interested in the intersections of geometry and combinatorics. My research is in rigidity theory - studying how combinatorial objects (such as simplicial complexes) realised in some space may be deformed whilst preserving some geometric properties (the lengths of their edges, volumes of their faces, etc.).
