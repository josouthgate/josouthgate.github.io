I am a PhD student in maths at the University of St Andrew under the primary supervision of Louis Theran, I have been here since 2020. Previously I was an undergraduate at the University of Bristol.

I am interested in the intersections of geometry and combinatorics. Specifically, my research is in rigidity theory - studying how combinatorial objects (such as simplicial complexes) realised in some space may be deformed whilst preserving some of their geometric properties (the lengths of their edges, or volumes of their faces).
