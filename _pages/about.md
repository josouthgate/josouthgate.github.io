I am a PhD candidate in pure maths at the University of St Andrew under the primary supervision of Louis Theran, I have been here since 2020. Previously I was an undergraduate at the University of Bristol.

I am interested in geometric problems with discrete or combinatorial aspects. My PhD is in rigidity theory, ie. how embeddings of a combinatorial objects (eg. graphs, hypergraphs) may be deformed while keeping some geometric properties unchanged.
