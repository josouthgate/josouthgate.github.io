I am a PhD candidate in pure maths at the University of St Andrew, I have been here since 2020. Previously I was an undergraduate at the University of Bristol.

I am interested in geometric problems with discrete or combinatorial aspects. My current research is in rigidity theory, ie. whether or not a graph realised in d-dimensional space may be deformed while keeping its edges the same lengths.
